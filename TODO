CODE
* XInput: allow UTF8 input for string but pure ASCII for identifiers
* get the color back for labels via textcolor()
* graph object with zoom and cursor
* review terminal interface
  - notebook style option back (?), though preserve terminal 
    interface as default --> notebook command?
  - graphics in text window ?
* make a decision about where to put the line variable and its size 
  according to the fact that multple string can expand up to 1 kbyte.
* better error handling with number of the line of the file and the
  name of function the error occurs in.
* fix parser issues
CMDS
* meta for outputing graphics to various formats (helper program?)
* protect command to protect some variables from being cleared (only
  outside of udf ie for global variables)
* a echo on/off command to allow commands executed from a file to be 
  echoed in the window.
* move store/restore functions from builtin to commands (or get
  them out?)
* comment on/off or simpler "my multiline";
* get out output on/off?
DOC
* more update on documentation:
  - graphics:
    One can make a pause on the graph screen by putting
    * shg: switch to graphics screen
    * wait(10) will stay on the graphics view 10s before getting
      back to the terminal screen.
      (the switch seems to get done at the end of the evaluation
      of the line: TO BE CHECKED).
MODULES
* integrate mark function in xplot, add a comb style for graph,
  add styles for xplot
* signal.e: digital filters
* More module development
MISC
* optionnally monitor graphically the stack use
