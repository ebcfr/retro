# Retro

A numerical matrix environment with low resource requirements

The project start from the 1993 program Euler version 3.04 that run,
at the time, on an Atari ST, but supported an X11 interface.

A new makefile, and here it just runs on Linux.

The goal is to backport some of the features of subsequent versions
of Euler, but try to get it as low resource hungry as possible, and
why not, make it run on a microcontroller.

## Install (Linux)

./xretro
